# Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-Neural-Networks
This project focuses on training neural networks to classify brain tumors from MRI scans. Build and optimize different neural network architectures using transfer learning and custom convolutional layers. Additionally, the Gemini 1.5 Flash model will be employed to generate explanations for the model's predictions.
